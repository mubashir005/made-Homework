# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Temp vs Agriculture MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do climate conditions influence agricultural productivity in South America?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
To explore how climate conditions influence agricultural productivity in South America, I selected specific climate data to capture essential temperature trends relevant to crop growth.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?resource=download&select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv
* Data Type: CSV

Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say itâ€™s a myth based on dodgy science. We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view.

### Datasource2: Agricultural Productivity
* Metadata URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL/metadata
* Data URL: https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Production_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas.zip
* Data Type: CSV

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides data on crop yields, types of crops grown, and agricultural productivity per country..
